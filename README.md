# bulkai

**bulkai** is a tool to generate AI images in bulk

## Features

**bulkai** works with the following AI image generators:

 - Midjourney
 - Bluewillow

**bulkai** automates the following tasks:

 - Send prompts to the AI
 - Upscale the generated images
 - Or crop the preview images if upscale is disabled
 - Optionally, generate variations of the generated images
 - Download the generated images
 - Create thumbnails
 - Generate a HTML album page with the generated images

## Installation

You can use the golang binary to install **bulkai**:

To install the cli:

```bash
go install github.com/igolaizola/bulkai/cmd/bulkai@latest
```

To install the GUI:

```bash
go install github.com/igolaizola/bulkai/cmd/bulkai-gui@latest
```

Or you can download the binary from the [releases](https://github.com/igolaizola/bulkai/releases)

## Usage: command-line interface 

The binary you need to use is `bulkai`.

### 1. Create session (only for the first time)

You first need to create a session file with the discord credentials and other information retrieved from your browser.
**bulkai** needs this to:

 - Be able to login to Discord
 - Mimic the browser and avoid being detected as a bot

Use the `bulkai create-session` command to create the session file.
It will open a chrome window and you will need to login to Discord.

```bash
bulkai create-session
```

### 2. Configure settings

You can configure different settings.
See the parameters section to see all available options: [Parameters](#parameters)

Using a configuration file in YAML format:

```bash
bulkai generate --config bulkai.yaml
```

bulkai.yaml
```yaml
bot: midjourney
album: cute-animals
download: true
upscale: true
variation: false
thumbnails: true
suffix: " --ar 3:2"
prompt:
  - cute-animals-1.txt
  - cute-animals-2.txt
  - cute monkey dancing on a tree
```

### 2. Launch

Use the `bulkai generate` command to launch the generation.
Images will be downloaded to the album name in the output directory specified in the configuration file.
You will be able to see the progress in the console.
This task can take a long time depending on the number of images to generate.

```bash
bulkai generate
```

You can press `Ctrl+C` to stop the generation.
If you want to resume the generation, just press launch the command again using the same settings and album name.
Prompt field will be ignored and the prompts will be loaded from the album.

## Usage: graphical user interface

The binary you need to use is `bulkaigui`.

### 1. Create session (only for the first time)

**bulkai** needs this to:

Images will be downloaded to the album name in the output directory specified in the configuration file.
You will be able to see the progress in the window.
This task can take a long time depending on the number of images to generate.
